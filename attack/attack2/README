INSTALLING

To get started you will need to install some dependencies. It should suffice to run

> pip install numpy scipy jax jaxlib matplotlib networkx

Sometimes JaX (or, more correctly, XLA) puts up a fight during the install,
but if the above works then everything should run properly.


EXTRACTING EXAMPLE MODELS

First, generate a model that we will extract by running

> python3 train_models.py 10-15-15-1 42

and then extract it with

> python3 extract.py 10-15-15-1 42

this should be quick to extract and then check the quality of this extraction with

> python3 check_solution_svd.py 10-15-15-1

or if you have MILP solver installed you can run

> python3 check_solution_milp.py 10-15-15-1

and then running the solver on /tmp/test.mod

By default, the code is set up so that it won't cheat and look at the weights of the
actual neural network we're extracting (and will throw ugly errors if we try).
Some logging looks better if we're allowed to cheat though (e.g., to catch errors
earlier in the process).

To enable this, set CHEATING=True in src/global_vars.py.


EXTRACTING YOUR OWN MODELS

The code can currently extract only fully-connected neural networks.

To extract a model, save it as a numpy array in the format [weights, biases]. For
example, a 20-10-1 network could be saved to models/UID_20-10-1.npy
[[np.random.normal(size=(20,10)), np.random.normal(size=(10, 1))], [np.zeros((10,)), np.zeros((1,))]]

and then run

> python extract.py UID 20-10-1
